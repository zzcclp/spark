/**
 * A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure, that is used to test whether
 * an element is a member of a set. It returns false when the element is definitely not in the
 * set, returns true when the element is probably in the set.
 *
 * Internally a Bloom filter is initialized with 2 information: how many space to use(number of
 * bits) and how many hash values to calculate for each record.  To get as lower false positive
 * probability as possible, user should call {@link BloomFilter#create} to automatically pick a
 * best combination of these 2 parameters.
 *
 * Currently the following data types are supported:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Byte}</li>
 *   <li>{@link Short}</li>
 *   <li>{@link Integer}</li>
 *   <li>{@link Long}</li>
 *   <li>{@link String}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The implementation is largely based on the {@code BloomFilter} class from guava.
